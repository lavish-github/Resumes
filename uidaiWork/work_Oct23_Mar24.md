### Project: Native to Flutter Bridge
#### Description
Implemented a cross-platform application as a Proof of Concept (POC) for establishing a Native to Flutter bridge. The application's functionality was to display the PID block of captured biometric in Flutter UI in every platform.

#### Key Accomplishments
- Completed the work to display the captured PID block of fingerprint passed from backend (Java) through the method channel to the frontend (Flutter UI).
- Endeavored to retrieve the package or driver name from the connected RD device, subsequently recognizing the necessity for assistance from vendors to obtain this
information.


### Project: Face RD

#### Description
The primary goal was to write the test cases to ensure that the application functions optimally under various environmental conditions.


#### Key Accomplishments
- Acquired proficiency in basic test-driven development and expanded my understanding of diverse technologies and frameworks for testing Java applications, such as JUnit and Mockito, through an - learning platform.
- Authored few test cases for specific classes within utils and telemetry modules.


### Project: Flutter Oauth application

#### Description
Developed a Flutter application as a Proof of Concept (POC) to showcase the OAuth functionality, aimed at enabling genuine customers to access the system while deterring malicious and fraudulent entities. The primary objective of this POC was to authenticate users with their credentials and obtain an access token for accessing the available resources.


#### Key Accomplishments
- Deepened my comprehension of OAuth 2.0, including its technical intricacies and advantages of using it in software development, through extensive research on the internet.
- Integrated the functionality to initiate the web browser for user authentication from the login screen provided by the OAuth provider.
- Used OKTA as the OAuth provider to manage all authentication and identity- related operations.
- Facilitated the transmission of the access token obtained through the web browser back to the Flutter application by the means of
deep linking.

### Project: Universal Client

#### Description
Made significant contributions to the development of the Desktop application for the Universal Client. These contributions were primarily focused on implementing the Adult Enrollment flow, NRI Enrollment flow, and various additional tasks assigned throughout the project's progression.

#### Key Accomplishments
- Collaborated on refining the user interface of the Demographics, References and Review tab within the Adult Enrollment flow, drawing inspiration from the UI design of the Foreign Resident enrollment section.
- Extensively explored various layout options using Java Swing and JavaFX during my involvement with the Review tab. Eventually, opted to integrate HTML with Java to enhance the UI design of the Review tab.
- Collaborated on the Digilocker integration task, involving the fetching of documents from the DIS (Document Integration Service) service and their attachment within the Reference screen.
- Implemented the entire end- to-end NRI enrollment flow, mirroring the approach taken with the Adult Enrollment process.
- Addressed numerous tasks and resolved a multitude of bugs encountered across all workflows throughout the project's progression.
- Conducted comprehensive and repeated testing of all workflows during my
engagement in this project.
- Modified the autofill feature for the address field to activate upon entering a valid Indian pincode in the NRI enrollment process, specifically tailored for non-Indian address scenarios.
- Implemented numerous adjustments within the Adult Enrollment flow as recommended by the staging team during the testing phase.

### Project: Other contributions

#### Description
Provided assistance to others in various activities and tasks within their project. My contributions facilitated smoother progress and collaboration across the team.

#### Key Accomplishments
- Assisted in the creation of packets from the frontend of the UC client to facilitate the testing of the SEDA flow.
- Contributed to the analysis of memory leakage issues within the Resident Foreign Enrollment flow of the UC client, utilizing various tools such as VisualVM, JProfiler, and others.
- Participated in extensive testing of multiple flows within the UC client and diligently reported identified bugs.
- Implemented modifications and addressed inconsistencies as requested in the Acknowledgment Slip and various other methods within the UC Demographics Service.
